    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A rack of lamb is topped with a herby crust before it's roasted. I have been using this recipe 
        for a long time, and enjoy making it for special occasions. 
        The lamb always comes out juicy and tender.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (7 bone) rack of lamb, trimmed and frenched</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). 
            Move the oven rack to the center position.</li>
        <li>Combine bread crumbs, garlic, rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper 
            in a small bowl; stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil to moisten 
            the mixture. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Season rack of lamb all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large heavy oven-proof skillet over high heat. 
            Add lamb and sear on all sides, about 1 to 2 minutes: set lamb aside for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Brush lamb with mustard and roll in bread crumb mixture until evenly coated. 
            Cover the ends of the bones with foil to prevent charring.</li>
        <li>Arrange the breaded rack of lamb bone-side down in the same skillet. 
            Roast in preheated oven for 12 to 18 minutes for medium; an instant-read 
            thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F 
            (54 degrees C), or continue to cook to desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Remove lamb from the skillet and allow to rest for 5 to 7 minutes, 
            loosely covered with foil, before carving between the ribs. Enjoy!</li>
